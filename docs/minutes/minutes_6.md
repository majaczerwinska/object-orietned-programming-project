what is happening right now:
we are missing drag and drop, and websockets

there are a lot of small things that need to be fixed and coded
1. we have tests on the backend, not everything is 100% tested
2. easiest way to get code contribution is adding tests
3. pjotr and tudor and maja will be assigned testing
4. galya lucas and andreas will be debugging the currently existing (partially) features
5. tags are not working, galya will fix this today
6. other minor stuff that need to be fixed in the scenes:
	1. tags don't need names
	2. you can create a board with same name and key as already existing board
7. testing frontend:
	1. frontend doesnt need to be tested to 100%
	2. frontend can be unit tested in the same way the backend is-with mock components
8. these are the only things missing from our basic functionality, then we can start working on the more advanced functions.
9. we split testing in 3, as well as small functionality issues
10. finish drag and drop, websockets and tags by the end of the week.

everyone knows what and how to do it, or at least no one said they don't know how.

Question about the backlog:
1. different servers contain different boards.
2. for cards, fast access to creating card on the board overview:
3. in the color requirements there is somethign abotu a color palette
	1. there is a defaukt background adn text color hardcoded
	2. the user can create sets of colors and fonts pairs
