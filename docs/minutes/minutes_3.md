### Before meeting start:
Questions about git - Galya has some branch consistency issues, resolved
Tudor has some ssh issues, resolved

# Agenda Items: 
## Opening by chairperson:
we don't have much to do right now, we will finish the backlog and after we learn javafx get started on the project setup

## Announcements: 
For next week we need to discuss how the coding should be split, upcoming deadlines are Meaningfull merge request.
nothing else - still too early in the project

## Approval of the agenda:
*(Does anyone have any additions to the agenda? what is missing that you would like to discuss?)*
no

## Approve minutes of prior meeting:
no

### [ SSH and Git check] - [ensure everyone can participate]
everyone has set up ssh and git properly and can push/pull from both the team repository and their own repo, some have completed others are on their way to completing the git assignment

On the instructions page on the course website we can see how the git assigment graph should look like by the time we are done with it.

### [ Backlog] - [discuss how we finish it]
work session after meeting today
~~Make a draft for questions for the client Q&A~~
No more Q&As, we should make a draft of everything we know about the app so we can properly finish the backlog assignment.

As soon as we finish the backlog we will start on the code structure:
- What do we need to do to start coding
- in what order to we do the setup
- create java classes-  plan out class structure
- we still don't know how to use javaFX, so we cannot start on the ui just yet.


### [ Meaningfull merge request] - [elaboration on assignment]
##### We need to figure how we will combine this task with our working-in-pairs structure

Since we need to have some code for the merge request to be meaningfull we need to start coding before next week. We will split up the work into 3 for 3 pairs of people. The pairs will work together but create two merge requests, each one from a diff user so that "*Everyone has a meaningfull merge request.*"


## Closing the meeting:
Lucas is the next chair,
Tudor should upload the current agenda to the drive
