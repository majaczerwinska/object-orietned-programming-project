### [Product Pitch] - [purpose of agenda item]
*timestamp:* 14:19
We need to film the final product pitch today
-?-> do we need 1 story or 3 to follow user stories?
<--- 3 stories, it doesnt make sense to have the admin panel as the first feature.
follow the rubric:
|Item|Description|Formalities|Follows the formatting guidelines (duration, structure, â€¦)|Clarity|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|The video is pleasant to watch, the content is readable and the audio can be followed.|Features|The video gives a good overview over the implemented features.|Interactions|The video clearly illustrates how the different parts of the application connect. The flows within the application and transitions between the different parts are shown.|


we present three user stories:

novice user, obvious ui
advanced user, great keyboard shortcuts
admin, clean moderating interface


### [HUE] - [purpose of agenda item]
Andreas updated it yesterday according to the rubric
Maja reduced the word count
What do we do about number of reviewers?
-> not worth the risk, reduce to 4 reviewers. don't mention it was a whole team, might confuse the reviewer and lose uneccessary points

today: go over it and make sure it is within word limit and doesn't confuse TAs in:
- number of reviewers
- prioritization of tasks

### [Deadlines on friday] - [personal assignments]
Buddycheck format wont be the same as the first one
