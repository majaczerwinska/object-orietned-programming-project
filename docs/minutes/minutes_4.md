### [ Agenda item 1] - [Official backlog review]
*timestamp:* 14:47
we will compare our backlog with the official result

stackeholders we got right
we missed terminology

non functional requirements - skipped

acceptance criteria is not in the official backlog

we can go over the user stories to create tasks and issues to make into meaningful merge requests.

we will use the official backlog as a tasklist to split between the members so each can make their own meaningful merge request.

we will need to connect to one talio servers from multiple clients -- important task

-------
Galya:

we met on thursday and made a plan for the class structure. we start from the backend so we have a database to work with when making the frontend

we started trying to work with spring, starting with the card class since its the lowest instance
I pushed that as my meaningful merge request
galya pulled and spent the weekend studying spring and managed to connect the frontend and backend

after this meeting we need to start programming, galya has planned a way of distribution

every meeting we should talk about what we have done and what we are doing so alex knows what we are doing and how much we are working.

info on the buddycheck:
its a questionare about our teammates 
-> kinda there to create drama
