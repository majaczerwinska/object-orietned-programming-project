### Before meeting start:
*timestamp:* 14:31
Galya has been working on the backend, has fixed the getters and almost the delete methods, which would conclude the backend
Lucas made an edit tag method
Pjotr made UI but no connection to backend, same as Tudor. Pjotr and Tudor should combine their UIs so they look more similar.

Galya just fixed the delete method.

Lucas has almost finished the tag management 

# Agenda Items: 


## Opening by chairperson:
*timestamp:* 14:39
First we need to start with what has happened in the week so far, since we havent seen each other in a week or two

Lucas: created the frontend for the tag manager and connected it to the database (partially works), basically done. Need to get a tag from a specific board

Pjotr, similar situation for the card overview except he hasn't connected it to the backend

When all the scenes are done we can connect all the components together.

Maja has been doin the board selection scene, a view of your boards and are able to create a new board. Wants to implement joining. a board with a boardkey but is still unsure how that works serverside.

Tudor: worked on the board creator menu

*timestamp:* 14:42

Galya has been working on refining backend
Should be done very soon, so no more issues will arise in backend until end of project

### [Heuristic Evaluation Discussion] - [Understand assignment, ensure completion]
*timestamp:* 14:52

theres a HUE draft deadline on friday, which we need to submit to get feedback.

In HUE we will evaluate other team's clients, which means a working client. 
If you have some scenes that are not completed on time we can sort of substitute with a mock

Galya texted the other team and tried to organize a meeting.

It is very important today and tomorrow we work a lot in order to be able to combine our work.


### [Focus on the future tasks] - [discuss what we have to do and how to distribute the rest of the work]
*timestamp:* 14:58

Until next week we need to have all the scenes currently started completed and connected.
After that we can start working on adding new features, testing and refining the currently existing ones.
