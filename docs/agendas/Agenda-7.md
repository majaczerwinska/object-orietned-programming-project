For everyone who was assigned more than they finished, they need to finish today so they can start working on the new tasks. There is still plenty of work to go around, the project is not yet completed.

Question: who still is waiting on someone else to complete their part to begin their's?

Question: who has looked into frontend testing? Those responsible for that should start studying while others begin refactoring.
