# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Very Good

Feedback: The repository has a good amount of commits. Sometimes the commit messages are unclear, but the size of the commits is resonable (most of the time 24060892, 2a8a1581).

#### Isolation

Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: it is not entirely clear to me what is being developed on each branch. There could be more MRs at this stage of the project.


#### Reviewability

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: N/A - I couldn't find too many meaningful MRs to see if this is the case


#### Code Reviews


Grade: Sufficient

Feedback: There is no code review other than the *approve* and some "Looks good to me" comments.


#### Build Server


Grade: Good

Feedback: Half of the builds are failing. Please fix this issue. On the other hand, nice checkstyle rules .
