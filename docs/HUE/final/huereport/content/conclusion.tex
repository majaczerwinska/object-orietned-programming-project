\subsection{Conclusion}
\indent In conclusion, the team has thoroughly evaluated the user experience design and identified several features that were not user-friendly, despite being logical from a developer's perspective. By cleaning up crucial pages, such as the landing and board overview, it is possible to achieve better distribution of functionality and prevent clutter in some areas or too much user input at once in others. To ensure the most significant issues are addressed, a prioritization was made to implement proposed improvements in each of the four key areas. These changes will significantly enhance the user experience and efficiency of the application, resulting in a more satisfying experience for the users. Overall, the evaluation has been a valuable exercise in identifying and resolving usability issues, and the team is confident that the proposed improvements will lead to a better product.
