This report presents the findings of a heuristic usability evaluation conducted on the Talio to-do list application. Aimed at identifying and prioritizing usability issues in the product by using recognized usability heuristics, a team of evaluators used a preview of the app to analyze it against the usability standards set in the study. The results indicate that the product has several usability issues that negatively affect the user experience, such as inadequate explanation of functionality, poor layout in certain scenes, and unnecessary or improperly placed buttons. Each problem was separately reported and analysed for its impact, severity, ease of repair and the frequency in which the problem might occur. The issues were then compiled into improvement areas, each highlighting the suggested improvements in a specific section of the app. Finally the results were concerted into action points. They can help with future design decisions, resulting in a more user-friendly and effective product.
