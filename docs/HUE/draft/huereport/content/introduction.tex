\section{Introduction}

This report aims to present the results of a heuristic usability evaluation for a prototype of a task management application. Intended to aid users in organising their tasks, the app will maintain a clear structure of cards (representing a task and its description) into lists, which all fit into boards. It was conducted by a partner group and it outlines the possible problems that could harm the overall experience of the user. The report will provide a guideline of how the prototype was evaluated through fixed heuristics, it will describe the severity of the issues found and propose solutions and improvements based on the results. These heuristics outline a model for how a user-friendly app should behave, and comparing this app against them will assist in future design choices. The prototype that has undergone the evaluation is a partially functioning version of the whole application, showing an overview of the server selection scene, the board selection scene, the public board, the tag manager, and the adding card, board, and task scenes.
